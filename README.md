# Real Estate Listing Site Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview
- **Objective:** Build a scalable real estate listing platform where agencies and individuals can list properties, users can browse/search, and transactions can be managed.
- **Tech Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** Next.js (for SEO and SSR)
  - **Backend:** NestJS (structured and scalable API)
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL
  - **ORM:** Prisma or TypeORM
  - **Authentication:** JWT + OAuth (Google, Facebook)
  - **Payments:** PayStack, Flutterwave, or ZPay for paid listings
  - **File Uploads:** Cloudinary or S3 for images
  - **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend), DigitalOcean/AWS (Backend & DB)

## 2. Feature Breakdown
### User Roles & Permissions
1. **Admin**
   - Manage users, listings, and transactions
   - Approve/reject listings
   - Manage payments
2. **Real Estate Agents**
   - Create, update, and delete their listings
   - Track payments for premium listings
3. **Buyers/Renters**
   - Browse listings with filters
   - Contact agents
   - Save favorites
   - Leave reviews

### Core Features

✅ **Search & Filters**
- Location-based search (city, region, etc.)
- Price range, property type, number of rooms
- Sorting by newest, price, popularity

✅ **Payment Integration**
- First listing free
- Premium listings require payment (PayStack/Flutterwave)
- Subscription plans for agencies

✅ **Messaging & Notifications**
- In-app messaging between buyers & agents
- Email notifications for inquiries and approvals

✅ **Analytics & Reports**
- Dashboard for admins and agents
- Listing performance metrics
- User engagement tracking

## 3. System Architecture
### Frontend (Next.js)
- Pages:
  - Home
  - Listings (with filters)
  - Property Details
  - Agent Profiles
  - Login/Register
  - Dashboard (Admin/Agent)
- State Management: `useState` and `useContext`
- Styling: TailwindCSS

### Backend (NestJS)
- Modules:
  - **Auth Module** (Passport.js for JWT & OAuth)
  - **User Module** (Admin, Agent, Buyer roles)
  - **Listing Module** (Property details, CRUD, filters)
  - **Payments Module** (PayStack/Flutterwave integration)
  - **Messaging Module** (User-to-agent chat)
  - **Notifications Module** (Emails, alerts)
- API: REST

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Tables:**
  - Users (id, name, email, role, password, createdAt)
  - Listings (id, title, description, price, location, agentId, status)
  - Images (id, listingId, imageUrl)
  - Messages (id, senderId, receiverId, content, createdAt)
  - Payments (id, userId, amount, status, createdAt)
  - Reviews (id, userId, agentId, rating, comment)
- **ORM:** Prisma or TypeORM

## 4. Development Plan
**Phase 1: Initial Setup**
- Set up monorepo (if preferred)
- Configure Next.js frontend and NestJS backend
- Set up PostgreSQL with Prisma/TypeORM

**Phase 2: Authentication & User Management**
- Implement JWT-based login/signup
- OAuth login with Google/Facebook
- Role-based access control

**Phase 3: Listing Management**
- Develop listing creation, update, and deletion
- Image uploads with Cloudinary/S3
- Implement search & filtering

**Phase 4: Payments & Monetization**
- Integrate PayStack/Flutterwave for payments
- Implement premium listings
- Add payment tracking dashboard

**Phase 5: Messaging & Notifications**
- Implement in-app messaging between buyers and agents
- Email notifications for new messages & approvals

**Phase 6: Deployment & Testing**
- Optimize performance (caching, DB indexing)
- Deploy frontend (Vercel), backend (DigitalOcean/AWS)
- Implement CI/CD for automated deployments

## 5. Tech Stack Decision Points
- **Next.js for SEO & SSR** (Real estate sites benefit from SEO)
- **NestJS for modular backend** (Good for large-scale applications)
- **Prisma vs. TypeORM?** Prisma offers a better developer experience, while TypeORM integrates well with NestJS.
- **REST API** (GraphQL is optional but not prioritized)
- **No Redis** (Data will be directly fetched from PostgreSQL)
